COMPASS
-------
Welcome! The COMPASS (Compositions of Mini-Planets for Atmospheric Statistical Study) Program is a JWST exoplanet atmospheres survey designed to build a critical link between atmospheric characterization and planetary demographics.

Our GitHub will be populated with scripts to reproduce all data analyses published as part of this program.
